# ISC_NarrativeRoles

Heroes and villains: Opposing narrative roles engage neural synchronization in the inferior frontal gyrus (2024)

The codes for the main analysis are written in Python and adapted from the Dartbrains tutorial: https://naturalistic-data.org/content/Intersubject_Correlation.html

The neuroimaging datasets used in the code (Sherlock and The Grand Budapest Hotel) can be accessed respectively at https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001132/versions/1.0.0 and https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003017/versions/1.0.3.

The timepoints during which the antagonists and protagonists appeared on screen need to be annotated in advance. Additionally, neuroimaging data from The Grand Budapest Hotel dataset should be preprocessed. Average activations within a whole-brain parcellation should also be precomputed before applying this code, following procedures described in detail in the manuscript.
